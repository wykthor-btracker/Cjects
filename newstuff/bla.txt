A chiseled statue would not make justice to what stands before you, his form is pleasant to look at, but his eyes draw more attention than usual, as his iris carries a bright shade of gold, and when it falls upon you, seems to  glow softly, his nose is small but  straight, his thin lips a pinkish tone, they glisten  softly, his chin is roundish but clean, his form isn't par to a  gladiator, but here and there some toned muscles can be seen, his posture lends him the appearance of an extra inch or two. On the back of his right hand, if uncovered, you can make out a motif of a {20}harp, the strings seem to be vibrating, as if an achord has  just been strung.  His voice is smooth, his accent is faintly noticeable.
If you pay attention to his eyes, you notice they are completely golden, pupiless.

A chiseled statue  would not make justice  to what stands before you, his  golden gaze, when lingering, seems to  g l o w  softly,  his  nose is small but  straight, his thin lips a pinkish tone, they glisten  softly, his chin is  roundish but clean, his form isn't par to a  gladiator, but here and there  some toned muscles can be seen, his  posture lends him the appearance of an  extra inch or two. On the back  of his right hand, if uncovered, you can make  out a motif of a {20}harp,  the strings seem to be vibrating, as if an achord has  just been strung.  His voice is smooth, his accent is faintly noticeable.
